            Ocean levels are rising at unprecedented rates.

            As a coastal city, Boston experiences the consequences of changes in sea level. Though the city already

          Since the 1950s, heavy precipitation has become more common around the world. 
          This trend will continue as the planet continues to warm, because warmer air can hold more water vapor.
          In the United States, the Midwest and Northeast have experienced the largest increase in 
          frequency of heavy precipitation events. <sup>5</sup>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The most immediate threat of heavy precipitation is flooding. 
          In urban areas such as Boston, floods have the ability to devastate roads and infrastructure, 
          harm human health, and overwhelm sewer systems.

              The primary indicators for changes to precipitation rates are
              extreme weather events such as prolonged droughts and flash flooding. <sup>5</sup> 
              These precursors are likely the cause for a rise in heavy precipitation events
              between 1987 and 1996, after remaining stready throughout the mid-1960s 
              to the mid-1980s.

              From 1997 to 2006, the average inches of precipitation per year increased even more dramatically 
              than in the previous decade; then plateaued from 2007 to 2016. As a result, cities in the 
              Northeast have experienced
              “heavy rain and snow resulting in about 1 to 2 inches of water a day depending on location

            Floods are among the most common natural disasters in the United States. They can cause
            loss of human life, destruction of property and an increase in waterborne diseases. As 
            global warming continues to exacerbate rises in sea level, it “detectably influences” 
            many variables that cause flooding, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

            Boston has historically surpassed national averages in annual flooding. Studies show this

              Early data shows Boston's location on the water may have boosted its susceptibility to flooding.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              From 1920 to 1990, the number of high-tide flood days, days on which tides inundated
              low-lying areas, increased steadily across the nation.
              But Boston consistently recorded more high-tide flood days per decade than the national average.

          <div id='flood-slide-2' class='hidden'>
            <h3 class='storyboard-h3'>1990-2010</h3>
            <p class="vis-text">
              In just two decades between 1990 and 2010, the number of high-tide flood days skyrocketed
              throughout the United States. But again, Boston faced an especially drastic spike in high-tide flooding.
              The number of flood days in Boston tripled from 1990 to 2010, while the national average doubled.
            <br/>
            <br/>
              Much of Boston’s infrastructure is not prepared to face continuous increases in annual flood days, 
              as it is one the United States' oldest cities. 
              Dated drainage systems are common in Boston and are not equipped to handle 
              repeated floods.<sup>3</sup>

          <div id='flood-slide-3' class='hidden'>
            <h3 class='storyboard-h3'>2000-2050</h3>
            <p class="vis-text">
              By 2050, Boston is predicted to experience 70 high-tide flood days per year. That is
              more than four times as many high-tide flood days as there were from 2010-2019.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Such a drastic rise in flooding “endangers crucial infrastructure in Boston, including waste and 
              stormwater systems, MBTA lines, and roads.” <sup>4</sup>

          The previous visualization shows the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA's,
          estimates for future sea-level rise in Boston. Even by intermediate 
          estimates, sea levels in Boston will rise by over a foot by 2050. High estimates are even more severe 
          and both projections only 
          worsen with time. Both high and intermediate estimates are far above the city code for development, which defines
          what degree of potential flood risk is safe for infrastructure development.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Boston endures worse high-tide flooding than most cities in the United States.<sup>3</sup> By NOAA's estimates,
          large portions of Boston, including Seaport, will be swallowed up by the sea in the coming century. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          We hope that this project will increase the Boston community's awareness of the problem, as well as
          motivate further research on the effect of rising sea levels in Boston.

    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>
      Our visual encodings show trends in flooding, heavy precipitation and sea level rise in Seaport, 
      Boston and the Northeast United States. The visualizations were created to be shown in Boston Globe 
      journalist David Abel’s documentary “Inundation Project,” about rising sea levels in Seaport. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Because our visual encodings will ultimately appear in a documentary, we got special permission from 
      the professor to use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects to create our visualizations. The 
      professor also allowed us to focus more on storytelling in our website, rather than the interactivity 
      required in the project description.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The first two visualizations, embedded as videos, will appear as-is in Abel’s documentary. The remaining 
      visualizations mimic those we created for Abel. We recreated the visualizations Abel will use in D3 to 
      adapt to the website display. For instance, the D3 encodings each use different colors because they 
      represent different datasets. For Abel’s documentary, all visualizations use the same color scheme and use 
      the context from the documentary to advise viewers on the encoding’s content.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The motivating question for Abel’s documentary, and in turn our project, is how rising sea levels will impact 
      the Seaport community in the coming century. Using past data and projections from NOAA and the First Street 
      Foundation, our visualizations show how the Seaport neighborhood specifically and the broader geographic areas 
      to which Seaport belongs will be impacted by sea level rise and its side effects.
